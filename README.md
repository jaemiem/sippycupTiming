Lap Timing App
Overview

This repository contains a Python application designed for timing laps using an RF transponder. The app reads TTL signals from the transponder via a USB-to-TTL adapter, logs lap times, and stores them in a CSV file for further analysis.
Features

    Real-time Lap Timing: Detects laps and calculates lap duration using TTL signals from an RF transponder.
    CSV Logging: Automatically logs lap times to a CSV file.
    Simple Setup: Uses a USB-to-TTL adapter to interface with the RF reader, making it compatible with various systems.
    Extensible: Easy to extend for handling multiple transponders, adding web interfaces, or integrating with databases.
